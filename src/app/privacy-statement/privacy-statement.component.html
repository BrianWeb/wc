This Usage Data may include information such as your computer&rsquo;s Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages of our Service that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, unique device identifiers and other diagnostic data.</p>
    <h4>Location Data</h4>

    <p>You can enable or disable location services when you use our Service at any time, through your device settings.</p>
    <h4>Tracking &amp; Cookies Data</h4>
    <p>We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to track the activity on our Service and hold certain information.</p>
    <p>Cookies are files with small amount of data which may include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to your browser from a website and stored on your device. Tracking technologies also used are beacons, tags, and scripts to collect and track information and to improve and analyse our Service.</p>
    <p>You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.</p>

    <h3>How Wood Concepts uses cookies</h3>
    <p>When you use and access the Service, we may place a number of cookies files in your web browser.</p>
    <p>We use cookies for the following purposes: to enable certain functions of the Service, and to provide analytics, such as Google Analytics.</p>

    <p><strong>GOOGLE ANALYTICS COOKIES AND IDENTIFIERS</strong></p>
    <p>This Service uses Google Analytics to monitor and analyse the use of our Service. Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website traffic. Google uses the data collected to track and monitor the use of our Service. This data may be shared with other Google services. Google may use the collected data to contextualise and personalise the ads of its own advertising network.</p>
    <p>You can opt-out of having made your activity on the Service available to Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. The add-on prevents the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, and dc.js) from sharing information with Google Analytics about visits activity.</p>
    <p>Users may disable cookies or delete any individual cookie.&nbsp;<a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/cookies">Learn more</a>. In addition, Google Analytics supports an optional browser&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">add-on</a>&nbsp;that - once installed and enabled - disables measurement by Google Analytics for any site a user visits. Note that this add-on only disables Google Analytics measurement.</p>
    <p>Google Analytics also collects Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to provide and protect the security of the service, and to give Wood Concepts a sense of which country, state, or city in the world their users come from (also known as "IP geolocation"). Google Analytics provides a method to mask IPs that are collected (detailed below) but note that website owners have access to their users&rsquo; IP addresses even if the website owners do not use Google Analytics.</p>
    <p>Wood Concepts does not send any&nbsp;other <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7686480">Personally Identifiable Information</a>&nbsp;to Google Analytics.</p>
    <p>For more information on the privacy practices of Google, please visit the Google Privacy &amp; Terms web page: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></p>

    <p><strong>Data Usage</strong></p>

    <p>Identifiers such as cookies and app instance IDs are used to measure user interactions with a customer&rsquo;s sites and/or apps, while IP addresses are used to provide and protect the security of the service, and to give the customer a sense of where in the world their users come from.</p>
    <p>We do not share Google Analytics data, except in circumstances when required by law.</p>
    <p>Security-dedicated engineering teams at Google guard against external threats to data. Internal access to data (e.g., by employees) is by strict access controls (both internal policy controls and automated technical controls such as authentication, SSL, and security logs) to only those with a business need to access it.</p>

    <h2><strong>Data privacy and security</strong></h2>
    <h3>Certifications</h3>
    <p>EU Privacy Shield</p>
    <p>The U.S. Department of Commerce has approved Google's certification to the Privacy Shield as fully compliant. View Google&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI">Privacy Shield certification</a>.</p>

    <p>ISO 27001</p>
    <p>Google has earned ISO 27001 certification for the systems, applications, people, technology, processes, and data centers serving a number of Google products, including Google Analytics.&nbsp;<a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/bk5ogXBjnUep68clvPvX8lSayrFt5ZZAMC5G">Download the certificate here (PDF)</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html">learn more about ISO 27001</a>.</p>

    <h3>Information security</h3>
    <p>In web-based computing, security of both data and applications is critical. Google dedicates significant resources towards securing applications and data handling to prevent unauthorized access to data.</p>

    <p>Data is stored in an encoded format optimized for performance, rather than stored in a traditional file system or database manner. Data is dispersed across a number of physical and logical volumes for redundancy and expedient access, thereby obfuscating it from tampering.</p>
    <p>Google applications run in a multi-tenant, distributed environment. Rather than segregating each customer's data onto a single machine or set of machines, data from all Google users (consumers, business, and even Google's own data) is distributed among a shared infrastructure composed of Google's many homogeneous machines and located in Google's data centers.</p>
    <p>In addition, Google Analytics ensures secure transmission of its JavaScript libraries and measurement data. Google Analytics by default uses HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), which instructs browsers that support HTTP over SSL (HTTPS) to use that encryption protocol for all communication between end users, websites, and Google Analytics servers.&nbsp;<a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6385009">Learn more</a></p>
